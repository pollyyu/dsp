[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> The series generating random numbers between 0 and 1 will not yield any visible pdf plot, because there is likely only one observation per number (given it's a decimal number). However, by plotting a cdf, we can observe a linear line which indicates that random.random() gives a uniform distribution.
